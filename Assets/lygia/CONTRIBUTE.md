# Contributing to LYIGA

LYGIA is a project that aims to provide a unified API for writing shaders in different shading languages, with carefully tailored code, optimized for each language. It is a community-driven project and we welcome contributions from everyone.

At the moment we are figuring the best way to organize the project and the best practices to follow. If you have any suggestions, please open an issue.

As a general guideline, we are following these rules:

* Everything goes through PRs. No standalone commits.
* PRs need to be peer-reviewed by at least one language lead
* PRs that change existing functions need to maintain language parity.

## Who are the language leads?

* GLSL: @patriciogonzalezvivo
* HLSL: Shadi El Hajj (@shadielhajj)
* WGSL: Stevan Dedovic (@sdedovic) 
* METAL: Anton Marini (@vade)
* CUDA: (help wanted)
* TSL: (help wanted)
* OSL: (help wanted)
